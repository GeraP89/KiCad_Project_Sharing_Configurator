# KiCad_Project_Sharing_Configurator
The purpose of this script is to aid in the process of sharing KiCAD projects by taking .lib and .pretty files that you may receieve from others and paste them in the KiCAD program files path. For this to work, said .lib and .pretty files must be stored within a .zip file, in the same file path this script is also stored in. For the purpose of this project I have named said .zip file as "Pia.Zip", 

Just double click the .bat file and it will run the script for you. You must have the PIA.zip file in the same folder as the .bat and .ps1 file for this to work.
